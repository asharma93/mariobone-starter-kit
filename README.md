====================
MarioBone-starter-kit v1.0 		 
====================

====================
Getting Started   
====================

$ npm install (If you have bower installed globally, bower install will kick off. You will have to do this manually otherwise.)

$ grunt && grunt server 

Go to localhost:8000.

Notes: I've put in place an example layout which is easily built upon. Remove this and drop in your own styles and layouts.

I've also included some dependencies I personally use the most. Remove these from bower.json if you don't intend on using them.


====================
Description   
====================

Starter kit & boilerplater for Backbone/Marionette applications

Ensure the ExampeApp.js under the js/ directory is changed in the context of the new application.

An example of Gruntfile.js, bower.json package.json has been
added, prefixed with 'example'. Be sure to remove these once you have set them up correctly.

Using JSHint to maintain code quality and detect errors.

====================
Development Tips
====================

1) 	Ensure a .gitignore file is in place to prevent
	unecessary items being pushed to git.

2)	Currently using Hanblesbars as the templating engine, this can be easily replaced with your own personal 		preference.

3) 	Using Sass for my CSS preprocessor. Also included Bourbon mixins which can be very handy, especially in 		regards to mutli-browser support. Checkout the docs here http://bourbon.io/


====================
Testing
====================

1) 	Added Jasmine to the list of dependencies. Due to the vast amount of variations of test 				environments, I'll leave this up to you to get started.
